# Voice Assistant

An open-source voice assistant.

### Modules
Voice Assistant is comprised of modules. Each module exports functions to initialize itself, tell the main handler whether it is capable of fulfilling a request, and actually fulfill the request.

Modules handle their own logic; the role of the main handler is to process transcription and call the modules.
